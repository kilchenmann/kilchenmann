### Hi there I'm AndrÃ©

Iâ€™m a web developer from Switzerland and working at the [Data and Service Center for the Humanities](https://dasch.swiss) on [web applications](https://github.com/dasch-swiss). I got my PhD in media studies / digital humanitis.


I like good and functional design and in my spare time I build my own furnitures, sew clothes and accessories and take photographs.
